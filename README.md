## Summary

Our web app lets users draw itinary from points to points on a *web mercator projection* while keeping track of the distance travelled as well as offering the ability to undo all previous jumps.

## How-To and Technologies

The source files must be hostedon on a server of some kind which and be part of the same directory.

The app makes use of the jQuery library to enable dragging and dropping functionality of elements on the page and to make Ajax requests necessary to interact with the Leaflet map.

Finally, the CSS features media queries in order to display our app in better fashion on mobile devices.
